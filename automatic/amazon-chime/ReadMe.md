## Amazon chime
Amazon Chime is a communications service that lets you meet, chat, and place business calls inside and outside your organization, 
all using a single application. Developers can use the same communications infrastructure and services that power Amazon 
Chime, and add audio calling, video calling, and screen sharing capabilities directly to their applications using the Amazon 
Chime SDK.

Amazon Chime Voice Connector is a service that enables enterprises to migrate their telephony workloads to AWS. IT professionals
can use Voice Connector for low-cost SIP trunking from on-premises or cloud-based phone systems. Voice Connector supports
inbound calling, outbound calling, or both. Developers can also use Voice Connector to build PSTN calling in their own 
applications using the Amazon Chime SDK or stream audio for phone call analytics and machine learning.
