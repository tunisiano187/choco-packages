## Lbry
It's time to take back control from YouTube and Amazon.

Top creators, self-respecting users, the privacy conscious, computer geeks, freedom 
lovers, loveable kooks, and readers of small gray text everywhere choose LBRY, because 
it's open, fair, and free.
The LBRY app is a graphical browser for the decentralized content marketplace provided 
by the LBRY protocol. It is essentially the lbry daemon bundled with a UI using Electron.
