## AgentSVN

Agent SVN is a commercial package that allows any MS-SCCI compatible IDE to use Subversion as it's source control provider.

The plug-in allows the IDE to seamlessly integrate with Subversion, such that IDE actions like adding, renaming, moving or removing files are automatically reflected in the Subversion repository.

The status of project files is tracked, not only local changes, but for changes made by other users.

It offers the option of using Subversion locks on check out or to run lock free and when locks are used they are fully managed by the plug-in.

The plug-in has been tested with all versions of Visual Studio up to and including VS2015.
