## Autoruns
See what programs are configured to startup automatically when your system boots and you login. 
Autoruns also shows you the full list of Registry and file locations where applications can 
configure auto-start settings. This utility, which has the most comprehensive knowledge of 
auto-starting locations of any startup monitor, shows you what programs are configured to run 
during system bootup or login, and when you start various built-in Windows applications like 
Internet Explorer, Explorer and media players. These programs and drivers include ones in your 
startup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other Registry keys. Autoruns reports Explorer shell 
extensions, toolbars, browser helper objects, Winlogon notifications, auto-start services, and 
much more. Autoruns goes way beyond other autostart utilities.
