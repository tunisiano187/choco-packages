## MozillaCacheView

MozillaCacheView is a small utility that reads the cache folder of Firefox/Mozilla/Netscape Web browsers, and displays the list of all files currently stored in the cache.

For each cache file, the following information is displayed: URL, Content type, File size, Last modified time, Last fetched time, Expiration time, Fetch count, Server name, and more.

You can easily select one or more items from the cache list, and then extract the files to another folder, or copy the URLs list to the clipboard.
