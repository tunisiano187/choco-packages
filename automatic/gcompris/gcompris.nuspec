GCompris is a high quality educational software suite, including a large number of activities for children aged 2 to 10.

Some of the activities are game orientated, but nonetheless still educational.

Here is the list of activity categories with some examples:

* computer discovery: keyboard, mouse, touchscreen ...
* reading: letters, words, reading practice, typing text ...
* arithmetic: numbers, operations, table memory, enumeration, double entry table ...
* science: the canal lock, the water cycle, renewable energy ...
* geography: countries, regions, culture ...
* games: chess, memory, align 4, hangman, tic-tac-toe ...
* other: colors, shapes, Braille, learn to tell time ...

Currently GCompris offers more than 100 activities, and more are being developed. GCompris is free software, it means that you can adapt it to your own needs, improve it, and most importantly share it with children everywhere.

The GCompris project is hosted and developed by the [KDE community](https://www.kde.org/).

### GCompris is now Free to install everywhere 2020-02-14 

Hi,

We are pleased to announce that the full version of GCompris is now available at no cost for every supported platform!

The installers for Windows and macOS on our website have been updated to not require activation code anymore, and the full version on the Play store and Microsoft store are now gratis.

We hope that this move will make it easier for all the children in the world to get access to the best educational software.


Thank you all,

Timothée & Johnny
