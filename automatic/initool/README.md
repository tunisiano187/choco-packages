## Initool
initool lets you manipulate the contents of INI files from the command line.

It is a rewrite of an earlier program by the author called "iniparse", which was written in Object Pascal for MS-DOS and later ported to Windows. initool has a backwards 
compatible command syntax but its operation differs; rather than modify INI files in place it outputs the modified file text to standard output.
