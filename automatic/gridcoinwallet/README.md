## gridcoinwallet
Gridcoin is a decentralized, open-source, math-based digital asset (cryptocurrency). Gridcoin, 
while energy-efficient, is the first and only cryptocurrency that rewards individuals for scientific 
contributions and performs transactions peer-to-peer cryptographically - without the need for a 
central authority to distribute rewards. It is the first block chain protocol that delivered a 
working algorithm that rewards and cryptographically proves solving BOINC (Berkeley Open 
Infrastructure for Network Computing) hosted work, which could be virtually any kind of 
computing process. Gridcoin provides benefits to humanity through contributions to 
computational research. There are no limitations to a single BOINC project, providing the 
flexibility to be rewarded for virtually any type of computational process. 
	The wallet and it's config file is stored in `%APPDATA%\GridcoinResearch`.
