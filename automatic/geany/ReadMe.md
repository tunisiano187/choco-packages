## geany
Features:Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment (IDE). It was developed
to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages. Another goal
was to be as independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME. So it is
using only the GTK2 toolkit and therefore you need only the GTK2 runtime libraries to run Geany.
